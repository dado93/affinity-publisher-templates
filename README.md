# Affinity Publisher Templates

This repository contains [Affinity Publisher](https://affinity.serif.com/it/publisher/) templates that you can use to create photobooks. 

I started this repository in order to have a more immediate access to the templates that I need to use to create photobooks with [Saal Digital](https://www.saal-digital.it). It was always a mess to go to Saal Digital website, check for the dimensions of the photobook that I wanted to create, and design a new template. That's why I decided to create this repository.

## How to use the templates
1. Either download the repository as a zip file or clone it on your local machine

``git@github.com:dado93/affinity-publisher-templates.git``

2. Open Affinity Publisher
3. Click on File --> Open
4. On the left toolbar, click on Templates and then on Add Template Folder
5. On the dialog window that will open, select the folder that you just downloaded
