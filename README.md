# Affinity Publisher Templates

This repository contains Affinity Publisher templates that you can use to create photobooks. I started this repository in order to have a more immediate access to the templates that I need to use to create photobooks with [Saal Digital](https://www.saal-digital.it). It was always a mess to go to the website, check for the dimensions of the photobook that I wanted to create, and design a new template. That's why I decided to create this repository.
